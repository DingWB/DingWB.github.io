  description: PyComplexHeatmap was designed to visualize matrix data and associated metadata through sophisticated, richly annotated heatmap layouts. We have integrated the R grammar-of-graphics semantics with the Python-native matplotlib/Pandas-based data science ecosystem, allowing users to utilize built-in matplotlib colormaps and project Pandas DataFrame directly as horizontal or vertical color bars. PyComplexHeatmap supports high-level data abstraction and can display up to five data dimensions within a single heatmap visualization.

  description: BAllCools is a comprehensive tool designed to handle binary AllC files (BAllC). The tool aims to solve the challenges posed by the large number of single-cell data. The conventional AllC files store methylation data as text, which becomes significantly bulky when dealing with single-cell data. BAllCools provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data by converting these text files into binary files, thereby saving substantial storage space. The BAllC format save >55% storage compared to AllC the format, and BAllCools accelorates BAllC operation like data merging (ballcools merge) ~30x.
